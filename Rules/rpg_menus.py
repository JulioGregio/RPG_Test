Neste ponto eu poderia ter feito mais simples e direto ao ponto, para evitar de ficar rolando
terminal pra saber algo, e de certa forma eu já poderia tirar a escolha de raça na sequência
sem precissar fazer outras funções apenas por estilo ou desejo de algo melhor, mas poderia ser
feito assim também. Talvez fosse útil para uma interface gráfica.

At this point I could have made it simpler and more to the point, to avoid scrolling
terminal to know something, and in a way I could already remove the choice of race in the sequence
without having to do other functions just for style or desire for something better, but it could be
done like that too. Perhaps it would be useful for a GUI.
